<HTML><BODY><i>Il Novellino</i>, also known as <i>Le ciento novelle antiche</i> (one hundred old tales) is the name of the oldest Italian collection of novellas from the second half of the thirteenth century. The collection can be considered the ancestor of an entire literary genre, which includes such well-known names as Boccaccio and Chaucer. The author from Tuscany is unknown, but probably lived in the neighborhood of Florence. The collection was edited at the beginning of the 14th century, and was printed in 1525 in Bologna by Carlo Gualteruzzi in a version edited by Pietro Bembo under the title <i>Cento Novelle Antiche</i>. A longer version by Vincenzo Borghini appeared as <i>Libro di Novelle e di bel Parlar gentile</i> at Giunta in Florence.

<p>Next to the central figure of Emperor Frederick the Second, the work deals with classical, biblical, and medieval themes. In the 73rd novella, <i>How the Sultan being in need of money, sought to find occasion to proceed against a Jew</i>, is an early example of the Ring Parable of religious toleration appearing in literature.

</p><p>Although earlier, fragments have been printed in English, this 1925 edition by Edward Storer appears to be the first complete translation.

</p><p>This 13th-century collection of 100 novellas should not be confused with the 15th-century work by Masuccio Salernitano with the same title.
